Course: Computer Science 210 - Intro to Computer Programming

Name: Average Calculator

    In this project, you will be creating a program that will process the scores that a student receives during
    a driving exam. You will not be creating the driving exam itself. The program is intended to process the
    scores after the exam has been completed.
    The program will ask for the student's name, the written exam score, and the practical exam score. Then,
    the overall score will be calculated using a specic formula designed below.
    Once the overall score is computed, the program will let the user know whether or not they passed.
